This Python script generates random horoscopes for each zodiac sign. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

import random`: This line imports the `random` module, which includes functions for generating random numbers.

zodiac_signs = ['Aries', 'Taurus', 'Gemini', 'Cancer', 'Leo', 'Virgo', 'Libra', 'Scorpio', 'Sagittarius', 'Capricorn', 'Aquarius', 'Pisces']`: This line defines a list of zodiac signs.

with open('predictions.txt', 'r') as f: predictions = [line.strip() for line in f]`: This block of code opens a file named `predictions.txt`
in read mode (`'r'`). It reads each line in the file, removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the line using the `strip()` method,
 and adds it to the `predictions` list.
 `for sign in zodiac_signs: prediction = random.choice(predictions) print(f"{sign}: {prediction}")`: 
 This block of code iterates over each zodiac mign in the `zodiac_signs` list. For each sign, it selects a random prediction 
 from the `predictions` list using the `random.choice()`function, and then prints the zodiac sign and its corresponding prediction.
